        DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [_Up C._] So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
        Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
        Agatha? [_Comes down_.]
        <br>
        LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma.
        <br>

        DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [_Sitting on sofa_.] Just let me see your card.
        I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
        safeguard. You dear simple little thing! [_Scratches out two names_.]
        No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons! It
        looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
        Mr. Hopper.
        <br>
        [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]
        <br>
        LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma.
        <br>

        DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [_Fanning herself_.] The air is so pleasant there.
        <br>
        PARKER. Mrs. Cowper-Cowper. Lady Stutfield. Sir James Royston. Mr.
        Guy Berkeley.
        <br>
        [_These people enter as announced_.]
        <br>
        DUMBY. Good evening, Lady Stutfield. I suppose this will be the last
        ball of the season?
        <br>
        LADY STUTFIELD. I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It’s been a delightful season,
        hasn’t it?
